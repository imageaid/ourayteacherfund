The Ouray Teacher Fund Application is a Ruby on Rails app built to assist the inner and outer workings of an education-based non-profit. 

Features include:
* Content Management System (CMS) for the website
  * Manage pages
  * Manage users, which are broken out as: users, donors, board members
  * Connect to an external donation system
* Basic public facing website to promote grants, applications and resources for teachers

If you think this base of code can help you out, have at it! We're happy to share if it can get someone else farther down the road with less work 😁
