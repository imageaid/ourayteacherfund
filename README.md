# Non-profit Application for the Ouray Teacher Fund

The Ouray Teacher Fund Application is a Ruby on Rails app built to assist the inner and outer workings of an education-based non-profit. 

Features include:
* Content Management System (CMS) for the website
  * Manage pages
  * Manage users, which are broken out as: users, donors, board members
  * Manage application questions
  * Collect emails for a mailing list
  * Link to an external donation system 
* Light and dark themes on CMS and the website
* Basic public facing website to promote grants, applications and resources for teachers
  * You can see it in action at: [https://www,ourayteacherfund.org](https://www,ourayteacherfund.org) (on or about September 18, 2023)
  * Note that the home (welcome) page is hard coded. If you do decide to use this for your own non-profit, you'll want to change that up. 

If you think this base of code can help you out, have at it! We're happy to share if it can get someone else farther down the road with less work üòÅ
